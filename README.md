If you have Python 3, this will be easy. If not, then WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> NOW!
<hr/>
Ok. You have Python now? Good.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: Download the source code as a zip file and unzip it.<br/>
Step 2: Navigate to the directory containing the contents of the zip file (INSIDE COMMAND LINE. you need to do it through a command line (Also my favorite command line for mac is iTerm2)). <br/>
Step 3: (In your command line) Run the command: <em>python3 -m http.server</em>. It should echo back: <em>Hosting on port <strong>http://...[8000]</strong>. I don't know if it is 8000 for everyone, but whatever it is, don't close terminal. Keep that line there. <br/>
  Step 4: Go to your browser (still keep Terminal open) and put in the address: <em>localhost:8000</em> (replace 8000 with whatever your number was, but mine says 8000).<br/>
  Step 5: You're playing snake now!
